Arrna Lokte, +4 Rapier

I've noticed a strong tendency toward evil-oriented weapons being created by
fans of Infinity Engine games. If not specifically evil in intent, then at
least possessive of characteristics associated with darkness and fey design,
such as the ability to poison or level drain. This tendency isn't bad in and of
itself, but I believe in playing in character, even in a single player capacity
when no one else is present to witness my character's actions, and I don't
believe that many good-aligned characters would be comfortable wielding a
weapon which poisons those whom it strikes or draws power from the negative
material plane, simply because those qualities are all too easily associated
with undead and assassins.

I've also noticed a lack of many items created by or made for elves, my
favourite race in D&D. This rapier, though deadly, is also elegant and
intricate in design, and comes with a new inventory BAM to reflect that.
Why should your high level elven ranger or bladesinger be forced to wield a
massive blade called "Death Reaper," forged by clumsy human hands and adorned
with crass effigies of skulls or spiders? To be sure, no good elf would ever
wield or wear anything with a spider emblem upon it - they would be much more
likely to spit upon it and curse the Drow. Arrna Lokte is a beautiful sword
with flowing lines and a scrolled basket hilt, the sort of weapon any elf would
be proud to wear upon his or her hip.

Lastly, Arrna Lokte is not overly powerful. Many items created by the gaming
community possess such power that they would only ever be found in a sane pen
and paper game as ancient, intelligent relics with very high egos - the sort of
weapons that would be far more likely to control a character than the other way
around. Arrna Lokte will not make a character invulnerable, nor will it speak
to a character and cast every spell known to the Gods. Though very powerful by
any sane standards, it remains balanced and quite suitable for high level
characters, particularly when one takes into account the existence of swords
such as Carsomyr.


In-game item description:

In Elven, Arrna Lokte means "Storm Blossom," the name of a wild flower which
grows upon the verdant hills of Evermeet and only blooms after an electrical
storm. As elegant as its name, this beautiful rapier is light and perfectly
balanced. Faint pulses of electricity seem to trace the edges of its blade,
upon which is inscribed in flowing Elven script, "Lightning strikes swiftly but
unpredictably."

Arrna Lokte's exact origins are a mystery, but as it can only only be wielded
by elves of good alignment and was forged near the begining of the elven
Retreat to Evermeet, many sages suggest that it was created to aid elves
in danger during that tumultuous period of their history.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------

None. Install per the standard instructions for IAP format files. See below for
further information.

==================================================================================
HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------
An exception to the following information is if you use the new IAP-SFX maker
to make self installing IAP files (*.exe).

To insert this custom file or file pack into your game, you need to download,
install and use TeamBG's IEES (Infinity Engine Editor Standard). This program
contains the Infinty Add-on Patcher. This is used to import custom files (TBG or
IAP files) into your game.  This process is like UNZIPPING a ZIP file. It drops
all the files into the right locations for your game to use them and makes the
updates to your master text file for your game so that all the new items, spells,
etc. have their new names and descriptions.

To get IEES (which can be used to install any IAP/TBG files you find on the web)
goto TeamBG's web site with this URL to go directly to the IEES download:

http://www.teambg.com/iees.htm

Now depending upon how the creator made this pack, there may be special
instructions about what to do to activate or spawn the item, spell, creature, or 
whatever when you actually run your game.  See the special instructions section
above for this information.
