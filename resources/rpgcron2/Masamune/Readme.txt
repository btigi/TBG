Readme - Masamune

Masamune is a custom item for Baldur's Gate II.  It is a Katana Holy Avenger, called Masamune.

To correctly import this item, you will need to download an editor called the Infinity Engine Editor.  It can be downloaded from:

http://www.teambg.com

When you have downloaded and installed the Infinity Engine Editor, run it, and click on the "Game Choise" option.  Choose Baldur's Gate II.  Then you will get a list of the editors avialable for BG2.  Click on "Infinity Addon Patcher".

After that, a new editor should open.  In that new editor, click the "Import TBG/IAP" button.  When you click it, you will get a map of your hard drive.  Find the file "masamune.tbg" that came with this readme, and click on.  The editor will import the item for you.

Now, you need to give the item to your character.  This is done using the cheat console.  If you do not have the cheat console enabled, then you need to do this:

Go into your Baldur's Gate II folder, and look for a file called "baldur.ini".  Open that file.  In that file, you should find a heading called "[Program Options]".  Under that heading, you need to add the line "Debug Mode=1".  Now, scroll down a bit, and you should find another heading called "[Game Options]".  Under that heading, add the line "Cheats=1".

Now, the console is enabled.  Start BG2, and load your saved game, or start a new game.  Press SPACE-TAB.  The cheat console will open at the bottom of the screen.  In the console, type:

CLUAConsole:CreateItem("masamune")

The Masamune Holy Avenger will be added to your inventory.
