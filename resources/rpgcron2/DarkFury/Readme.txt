HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------
An exception to the following information is if you use the new IAP-SFX maker
to make self installing IAP files (*.exe).

To insert this custom file or file pack into your game, you need to download,
install and use TeamBG's IEES (Infinity Engine Editor Standard). This program
contains the Infinty Add-on Patcher. This is used to import custom files (TBG or
IAP files) into your game.  This process is like UNZIPPING a ZIP file. It drops
all the files into the right locations for your game to use them and makes the
updates to your master text file for your game so that all the new items, spells,
etc. have their new names and descriptions.

To get IEES (which can be used to install any IAP/TBG files you find on the web)
goto TeamBG's web site with this URL to go directly to the IEES download:

Now depending upon how the creator made this pack, there may be special
instructions about what to do to activate or spawn the item, spell, creature, or 
whatever when you actually run your game.  See the special instructions section
above for this information.
