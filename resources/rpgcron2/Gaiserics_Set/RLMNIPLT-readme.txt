RILMANI PLATE
This brightly colored Plate Mail was created for the Tiefling Rilmani Fighters of Sigil. This powerful plate is known to provide extensive and powerful protections on the wearer. In addition, the enchantments of this plate mail will alter the wearer's appearance, leading some to believe that those who where it may actually be a Rilmani from Sigil. It might not be a good idea to wear it in the presence of Tieflings or other Planar beings, since their reaction to it is not easily predicted. How it came to be in your possesion is not known, although it could have come from Ferrumach Rilmani when he was killed by intruders into the Watcher's Keep prison.
