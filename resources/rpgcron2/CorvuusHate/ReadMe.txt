Short Sword +4, Corvuus's Hate

This short sword was first used by Corvuus, a mercenary assassin with a special dislike for mages. Corvuus was the best at what he did and therefore charged some very high prices. The jobs were always finished right, however. Corvuus received this sword as a +3 short sword after an argument with an employer over payment that ended in bloodshed. Soon, it became his favorite sword to use in his jobs and he used right up until his natural life ended.

Corvuus never actually died, however, but was imprisoned in his own sword after a failed assassination attempt on a very powerful mage called Nava. His hatred of mages became even more so after this, and this part of him also became part of the blade. Somehow Corvuus managed to put his feeling of hate into the blade, causing it to become a mage killer. The blade also glows red with hate.
