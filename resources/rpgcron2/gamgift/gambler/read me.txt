Pack Contents/Description:
This dagger is sort of like the jester's axe from PST.
when it's equipped there is one of forty effects randomly chosen ranging from a
stat change to haste. It can be used as a normal dagger or a throwing dagger.
every attack has a randomly picked effect like maze or fire damage on the enemy 
or yourself. this dagger is just plain gambling and is pretty strange.
The name of the file to import into the gme is gamgift.

HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------
To insert this custom file or file pack into your game, you need to download,
install and use TeamBG's IEES (Infinity Engine Editor Standard). This program
contains the Infinty Add-on Patcher. This is used to import custom files (TBG or
IAP files) into your game.  This process is like UNZIPPING a ZIP file. It drops
all the files into the right locations for your game to use them and makes the
updates to your master text file for your game so that all the new items, spells,
etc. have their new names and descriptions.

To get IEES (which can be used to install any IAP/TBG files you find on the web)
goto TeamBG's web site with this URL to go directly to the IEES download:

Now depending upon how the creator made this pack, there may be special
instructions about what to do to activate or spawn the item, spell, creature, or 
whatever when you actually run your game.  See the special instructions section
above for this information.
