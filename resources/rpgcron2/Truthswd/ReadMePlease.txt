You should see this file:

Truthswd.iap

Now extract it and then import it using IAAP(Infinity Add-On Patcher) which is part of 
IEEP(Infinity Engine Editor Pro).

If you don't have the Cheat mode enabled then do this first:

Go into Baldur.ini in your BG2 folder and type this under Game Options: Debug Mode=1.

Now start your game and hit CTRL and SPACEBAR at the same time. Then type 
CLUAConsole:CreateItem("xxxxxxxx"), where "xxxxxxxx" would be "Truthswd".

** How to Test the item **

-Start a tutorial with a warrior who has the Bastard sword proficiency, is of Good alignment,
 and has Strength 18+, Wisdom 16+, Int 9+.

-Import some evil creatures by typing CLUAConsole:CreateItem("xxxxxxxx") where "xxxxxxxx" is
 the name of the creature. Try "Drow01" or "Weregrdr".

-Now if you haven't already done so, identify the sword and learn about its bonuses. (heh no penalties
 this is a great sword to smite evil with). :)
