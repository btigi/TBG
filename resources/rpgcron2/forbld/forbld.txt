The FourBlade: Katana +5

  While it appears to be simply a well-made katana, the FourBlade is anything but. It was
given to Arawn Chen from his master, Baek Chen, shortly before the Ranger's own death. Baek
preferred the slender blades of the katana and the wakizashi because they were better-suited
to his speed-oriented style of kung fu, Pak Mei.
  A powerful weapon on its own right, FourBlade's true power resides in the four gems inset
into the katana's pommel: A ruby, a diamond, a sapphire, and an emerald. In addition to any
damage done by the weapon's extraordinarily keen blade, the FourBlade will also incur either
Fire, Ice, Lightning, or Acid damage to its target.
  The mysteries surrounding this weapon's creation are just that:  Mysteries.
  Baek used the blade for many years but never claimed to have crafted it himelf; nor did
he reveal from whom it had been given.
  Upon receiving it himself, Arawn used the blade his entire life; carrying it in every
encounter from vanquishing vampir to the long years during and after the Gondevahr Wars.
As such, Arawn has formed a magical, almost sembiotic, relationship with the katana and no
one else would be able to use it nearly as effectively in battle. The bushi warrior became
so deft, so deadly quick, with the weapon that no one has ever been able to draw in battle
before him.
