Pack Contents/Description:
This pack changes dak'kon's zerth blade so that it changes into more powerful 
versions of itself as you level up. At levels 10,15,20 and 25 it changes.
The fifth version cannot be gained normally with SoA unless you have an exp.cap
remover installed or have ToB.the other to get it is to type 
CLUAConsole:CreateItem("wa2dak5").
This pack replaces the original "dak'kon's zerth blade" that can be bought off
a bonus merchant in ribalds adventure mart. the only difference between the 
original and my version is that mine was cahnged so that it'll level up.
The files included are:
wa2dak.tbg
wa2dak2.tbg
wa2dak3.tbg
wa2dak4.tbg

HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------
To insert this custom file or file pack into your game, you need to download,
install and use TeamBG's IEES (Infinity Engine Editor Standard). This program
contains the Infinty Add-on Patcher. This is used to import custom files (TBG or
IAP files) into your game.  This process is like UNZIPPING a ZIP file. It drops
all the files into the right locations for your game to use them and makes the
updates to your master text file for your game so that all the new items, spells,
etc. have their new names and descriptions.

To get IEES (which can be used to install any IAP/TBG files you find on the web)
goto TeamBG's web site with this URL to go directly to the IEES download:

Now depending upon how the creator made this pack, there may be special
instructions about what to do to activate or spawn the item, spell, creature, or 
whatever when you actually run your game.  See the special instructions section
above for this information.
