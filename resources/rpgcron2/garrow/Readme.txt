I took this cool item from Icewind dale Heart of Winter and modified it for bg2 and Tob

These arrows are known less for their damaging power than they are for 
their annoying summoning power.  
Invented by a black-hearted gnome named Turbar Talinbar, 
the Goblin Arrows are commonly found in the quivers of mischievous halflings and elves.  
Several adventuring companies use the Goblin Arrows before launching any major attacks.
