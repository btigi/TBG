Sash of the Cat and Cobra

  Besides making the simple hand and foot deadly weapons, the martial arts practiced
throughout the realms center around the focusing of chi, or spirit, and the centering
of the body with the mind and the spirit. Regardless of their actual skill level, for many
the practicing of a martial art is as much a religion as the worshipping of any god.
  "Cat" and "Cobra" were two seperate styles of Kung Fu taught to the human Fei Wu Jandel
by the elven Ki`Del Brotherhood in the far southern regions of Kara-Tur. Just prior to
leaving his monastary, Fei Wu was able to combine the two styles into a deadly art that
gave its practitioner the skills and bonuses of both.
  "Cat" allowed for great agility and speed during combat, using swift hand strikes in
long, low stances while "Cobra" was equally quick but coiled and vicious in its attack,
sometimes killing opponents with a single blow.
  A slightly faster than normal healing factor and the dexterity to dodge and even strike
missile weapons from the very air are two of the duel arts' more complex and valuable
abilities. Due to the extensive meditation required in mimicing the animals of "Cat and
Cobra", the martial artist is able to sense ripples in the air around him; ripples created
by the motion of bodies in space, regardless if they are visible to the eye or not.
  This sash is only the symbolic representation of Fei Wu's Kung Fu, worn while he trained
in the art, and as such has no armor class or real magics innate unto itself.
